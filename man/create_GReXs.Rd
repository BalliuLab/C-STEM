\usage{
create_GReXs(
  gene_name,
  out_dir,

  exp_files = NULL,
  context_thresh = 3,
  alpha = 0.5,
  num_folds = 10,

}
\arguments{
\item{gene_name}{\itemize{
\item identifier for current gene being run. Add this prefix to all the saved results files... necessary to distinguish results where more than one gene-analysis is run.
}}

\item{out_dir}{\itemize{
\item output directory for GReXs
}}

\item{genotype_file}{\itemize{
\item a genotype file with the set of individuals in all Y_files and their corresponding cis-SNPs. Individuals are row names, no column names
}}

\item{exp_files}{\itemize{
\item vector with list of all expression files per context. The individuals (row names) must be a subset of genotype (genotype_file). Contains an unnamed
}}

\item{context_thresh}{\itemize{
\item minimum number of contexts to run crocotel on.
}}

\item{alpha}{\itemize{
\item The regularization constant. Default is .5 (eNet). Minimum value of 1e-4.
}}

\item{num_folds}{\itemize{
\item Number of folds for cross-validation
}}

\item{method}{\itemize{
\item Takes values of "crocotel" or "cxc". Default is "crocotel", if "cxc" then will not run decomposition and will build GReXs in a context by context manner.
}}
}
\value{
writes out a file of predicted expression across individuals and contexts
